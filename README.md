## Assignment Guidance: Designing A/B Testing for Spotify

### Overview

This assignment aims to guide you through designing an A/B testing experiment for Spotify. The goal is to compare the performance of a new feature or change (Target Group) against the current version (Control Group). 

### Objectives

1. Understand the principles of A/B testing.
2. Learn how to design an A/B test with a control and target group.
3. Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of the new feature.

### Key Components

1. **Objective Definition**
2. **Hypothesis Formulation**
3. **Test Design**
4. **Data Collection**
5. **Data Analysis**
6. **Result Interpretation**
7. **Reporting**

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Objective Definition

Define the primary objective of your A/B test. For example:
- Assess the impact of a new playlist recommendation algorithm on user engagement.
- Determine if a redesigned user interface increases the frequency of song skips.

#### 2. Hypothesis Formulation

Formulate a clear and testable hypothesis. For example:
- **Hypothesis:** Users exposed to the new playlist recommendation algorithm will have higher engagement metrics compared to users with the current algorithm.
- **Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant difference in user engagement between the two groups.

#### 3. Test Design

Design the test to ensure it provides reliable and valid results.

- **Groups:**
  - **Control Group:** Users experiencing the current version of Spotify.
  - **Target Group:** Users experiencing the new feature or change.
- **Sample Size:** Determine the number of users needed in each group to detect a statistically significant difference. Use power analysis to calculate this.

- **Randomization:** Randomly assign users to the control or target group to eliminate bias.

- **Duration:** Decide on the duration of the test. Ensure it is long enough to capture sufficient data.

#### 4. Data Collection

Identify the metrics to be tracked. For example:

- **User Engagement:** Number of playlists created, number of songs played, time spent on the app.
- **Feature Interaction:** Frequency of use of the new feature.
- **User Retention:** Number of returning users after a specific period.

Implement tracking mechanisms to collect data accurately from both groups.

#### 5. Data Analysis

Analyze the collected data to compare the performance of the control and target groups.

- **Statistical Tests:** Use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-square test) to compare the metrics between the two groups.
- **Significance Level:** Determine the p-value to assess the significance of the results (commonly p < 0.05).

#### 6. Result Interpretation

Interpret the results based on the statistical analysis.

- **If the p-value is less than 0.05:** Reject the null hypothesis. Conclude that the new feature significantly impacts user engagement.
- **If the p-value is greater than 0.05:** Fail to reject the null hypothesis. Conclude that there is no significant difference between the two groups.

#### 7. Reporting

Prepare a comprehensive report documenting the A/B testing process and findings.

- **Introduction:** Brief overview of the test objective and hypothesis.
- **Methodology:** Detailed description of the test design, sample size, randomization process, and duration.
- **Data Collection:** Explanation of the metrics tracked and data collection methods.
- **Analysis:** Presentation of the statistical tests used and the results obtained.
- **Conclusion:** Interpretation of the results and their implications.
- **Recommendations:** Suggestions for further action based on the test results.

### Submission

### Grading Criteria

1. **Objective Definition:** Clarity and relevance of the objective.
2. **Hypothesis Formulation:** Clear and testable hypothesis.
3. **Test Design:** Adequate design ensuring valid and reliable results.
4. **Data Collection:** Accurate and comprehensive data collection.
5. **Data Analysis:** Appropriate use of statistical tests and accurate analysis.
